# Space-invaders-game

Space invaders, save us from all the aliens. 
This is a time when games were mean't to be enjoyed, Arcade style. 

JavaScript is the preferred coding language used for this game.

The coding concepts used were as follows:
..........................................................................
.appendChild()
.createElement()
Array.from()
,querySelectorAll()
.length()
Includes()
.classList.add()
.classList.contains()
.classList.remove()
setInterval()
.innerHTML
setTimeout()
seitch()
e.key
..........................................................................

Game components:
The game components that were considered within the functionality include:
-Gun
-Invaders
-Shooters

How it works:
Shoot all the invaders and save the world from a complete apocalypse. 

1. The player will use the gun to aim at each invader.
2. To shoot the player will need to simply attempt to click on the invader as it passes by. 
3. Succession will lead to the player advancing to a new level. 

Launch:
Simply use Visual Studio Code or any HTML/JS/CSS compatible IDE(Integrated development environment) of your choice. 

The code was originally constructed by Ania Kub√≥w of Free code camp. This is used as a basepoint for future adaptions that I aim to make of this game.
